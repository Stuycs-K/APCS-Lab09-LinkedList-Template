# APCS-Lab11-MyLinkedList

Complete the Node and List classes, then test your list class. 

toString() is required. The format is just like the ArrayList: comma+space separated values inside of square brackets. Examplels: "[]" or "[value1]" or "[value1, value2, value3]"

toStringReversed() is highly suggested but will not be explicitly tested.

LinkedList has the same Exceptions as the SuperArray. I will not be explicitly testing the Exceptions, however if you do not use them, it would be difficult to determine why your lab fails.

Hint: You can use the same tester you used for your SuperArray!

# Required Diagrams


You will be CREATING YOUR OWN diagrams and adding them to your repo. You will be uploading an image file that can be a photograph of your hand drawn diagram, or created in a paint/diagram program.

A diagram of `add(index,value)` is required

A diagram of `remove()` is required It is the same for by value or by index.

The diagram should include the special cases (such as adding to the end when the list is empty)

Update this README.md file to include your images. (add the image to your repo, and link to your image in your readme file.)
