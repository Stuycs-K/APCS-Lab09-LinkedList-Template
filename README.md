# Required Diagrams


You will be CREATING YOUR OWN diagrams and adding them to your repo. You will be uploading an image file that can be a photograph of your hand drawn diagram, or created in a paint/diagram program.

You must add your diagrams just like a regular source file. Put them in your local repo, and add/commit/push.

A diagram of `add(index,value)` is required

A diagram of `remove()` is required It is the same for by value or by index.

The diagram should include the special cases (such as adding to the end when the list is empty)

Update this README.md file to include your images. (add the image to your repo, and change the cat.jpg links above.)
